# MK8-Cheat-Codes
List of Cafe/Gecko codes for Mario Kart 8 (v4.1, USA)

Codes gathered from various sources online and some by me.

Since MK8-Deluxe has been released and the amount of online players on MK8 has started to decline, people have begun to release more and more cheat codes for MK8. I thought I'd share some of the ones I've seen and some I created myself. All codes should work online as well unless specified otherwise.

**Code format:**
```
Code Name [Author's Name]

Notes about code if needed

C00000DE C00000DE
C00000DE C00000DE
```

## Instructions
Run in JGecko U with the CosmoCortney codehandler.
